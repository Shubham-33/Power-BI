# Power-BI-Project Summary: Maven Toys Sales & Inventory Data Analysis

I'm excited to present my work on the Maven Toys Sales & Inventory Data Analysis project. In this endeavor, I delved into a comprehensive dataset from Maven Toys, a fictional toy store chain based in Mexico. The dataset provided an excellent opportunity to showcase my data exploration, analysis, and visualization skills.

**Dataset Overview:**
The dataset consisted of four CSV format tables:

**Products Table:** This table featured 35 unique products offered by Maven Toys. It included details about product categories, costs, and retail prices.

**Stores Table:** With 50 records, this table presented Maven Toys' store locations, each entry containing information about the store's location, type, and opening date.

**Sales Table**: A sizable dataset containing over 800,000 sales transactions spanning from January 2017 to October 2018. Each record captured the purchase of a specific product at a specific store on a specific date.

**Inventory Table:** Comprising more than 1,500 records, this table offered insights into the stock on hand for each product across each store as of October 1, 2018.

**Project Objective**:
In the role of a BI consultant hired by Maven Toys, I embarked on the Maven Toys Challenge. The challenge entailed uncovering patterns and trends within the data to inform potential business expansion decisions. My task was to craft a one-page visualization or dashboard outlining an expansion plan, substantiated by the insights gleaned from my analysis.

**Key Accomplishments:**
I meticulously examined the data, employing various data visualization tools and techniques. The resulting dashboard presents an insightful view of the business landscape, shedding light on sales patterns, popular products, and potential store expansion opportunities. My analysis empowered Maven Toys with data-driven insights to make informed decisions for their growth strategy.
